# Research Orchestration - One Agent Per Research Chunk

Fill the analysis-heavy frameworks with sourced findings by fanning out **one independent research subagent per research chunk** via the **Agent tool** (parallel, dispatched in a single message). Each agent owns exactly one chunk, returns structured sourced data for that chunk only, and is blind to the others. A single-threaded synthesis step then writes the consolidating chunks (12 SWOT, 22 scoreboard) and propagates shared values.

Only chunks **06–11** do independent web research, so only they get an agent. Chunk 12 (SWOT) and chunk 22 (Tier-5 scoreboard) are **not** agents - they are derived in synthesis from upstream chunks. Tiers 1, 3, 4 (chunks 01–05, 13–21) are authored from intake, not research.

## Per-chunk research agents (six, run concurrently)

1. **Chunk 06 - Competitor scan + feature comparison.** Identify the top 5 competing products. For each: provider, best-for, key features, pricing model, weaknesses, positioning, tech stack. Then build the **feature comparison matrix**: enumerate the relevant feature set as rows and mark each feature **Available / Not available** per competitor across the columns. The feature-by-feature comparison across competitors is required, not optional.
2. **Chunk 07 - Market sizing.** Size TAM/SAM/SOM both ways. Top-down: global market → region share → % relevant to segment. Bottom-up: addressable customers × ARPU. Return every figure with a source and the assumption behind it.
3. **Chunk 08 - PESTLE.** Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental factors, each with a sourced rationale.
4. **Chunk 09 - Porter's Five Forces.** Each force scored 1–3 with a one-line rationale.
5. **Chunk 10 - EFAS.** External opportunities + threats, each with weight 0–1 and rating 1–5.
6. **Chunk 11 - IFAS.** Internal strengths + weaknesses, each with weight 0–1 and rating 1–5.

Each agent's prompt must name its single target chunk and return only that chunk's Answer slots. Do not let an agent author or speculate about another chunk's content.

## Source rules
- Acceptable sources: industry reports (Statista, Gartner, IBISWorld), Crunchbase/PitchBook, Google Trends/Keyword Planner, government statistics portals, vendor sites for competitor facts.
- Every numeric claim cites a source. No source and not derivable → `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: <question>]`, never a guessed number.
- Prefer recent data; record the year of each figure.

## Output schema per agent
Return JSON-like structured text: the framework's Answer slots, each with `value`, `source`, `year`, and `assumption` (where relevant). The synthesis step maps these into the chunk tables and computes derived values per `frameworks.md`.

**Label the scope of every magnitude.** Each agent works blind to the others, so the same pool gets sized differently unless scoped. Every market size, CAGR, region/market share, and customer/unit count must carry an explicit scope label and year - e.g. "global all-asset PM software, 2024" vs "US residential community / HOA & condo software, 2024" vs "global proptech, 2024". An unlabelled magnitude is incomplete output.

## Synthesis and propagation (single-threaded, after all agents return)
This step runs in the main context, not as an agent, so cross-chunk coherence is preserved:
1. **Reconcile shared figures first.** Any magnitude cited by more than one chunk - market size, CAGR, region/market share, customer or unit counts - MUST resolve to a **single canonical value with one explicit scope label and year**, used identically everywhere it appears (06, 07, 09, 10, 16, 22). Different agents will return different numbers because they chose different scopes; pick the narrowest defensible scope for the product, state it once, and make every chunk agree (a "Definitions / canonical figures" note in 07 is a good home). Where a chunk legitimately needs a different scope (e.g. Porter's rivalry sized on the broad market), keep the number but label the scope so it is visibly a different pool, not a contradiction. Divergent numbers for the same pool are a defect the reviewer will flag.
2. Write chunks 06–11 from each agent's returned bundle, applying the reconciled canonical figures.
3. Compute derived totals: Porter's average (from 09), EFAS/IFAS weighted sums (from 10, 11).
4. **Consolidate chunk 12 (SWOT)** from the EFAS (10) and IFAS (11) outputs - SWOT is derived here, never fetched by an agent.
5. Carry the propagation map in `frameworks.md` into the **Tier-5 Executive Summary (22)**, keeping it consistent with the tier-2/3/4 signals.

Tiers 1, 3, 4 are authored from intake + the research bundle (they are framing/prioritization, not new web research).

## Optional accelerator
The same playbook can run under the Workflow tool for heavier deterministic pipelines, but only when the user explicitly opts into multi-agent orchestration. Default is Agent-tool fan-out.
