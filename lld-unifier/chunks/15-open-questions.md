# 18. Open Questions & Flag Index

> **How to use this chunk:** this is the single review surface. Every `> Confirm:`, `> TODO:`, `⚠ drift`, `🆕 code-only`, and `⛔ sdd-only` marker placed anywhere in the LLD has a row here pointing to its location. Reviewers should:
>
> 1. Open this file first.
> 2. Walk the tables in order — Drift first (action items), then TODO (low-confidence), then Confirm (medium-confidence).
> 3. Edit the source chunk to resolve each row.
> 4. Re-run `/lld-unifier` (with `--regenerate` if needed) to refresh this index.

## 18.1 Drift Markers (hybrid mode only)

<!-- Every row carries the author's recommended reconciliation AND the reason behind it - never a bare "Pending". -->

| Location | Marker | Summary | Severity | Recommended resolution | Why | Status |
|----------|--------|---------|----------|------------------------|-----|--------|
| `[chunk:section]` | `⚠ drift` | [SDD says X, code does Y] | [High / Medium / Low] | [Reconcile in code / Reconcile in SDD] | [Reason, e.g., "code behaviour is live and consumers depend on it - update the SDD"] | [Pending / Done] |
| `[chunk:section]` | `🆕 code-only` | [Feature in code not in SDD] | [Severity] | [Backfill SDD / Remove from code] | [Reason] | [Pending / Done] |
| `[chunk:section]` | `⛔ sdd-only` | [In SDD, not yet built] | [Severity] | [Implement / Defer] | [Reason] | [Pending / Done] |

> **Severity guide:**
> - **High:** affects security, data integrity, or contract surface.
> - **Medium:** affects observability, performance, or cross-team integration.
> - **Low:** naming, documentation, or non-load-bearing detail.

## 18.2 Low-Confidence Inferences (TODO)

| Location | Best-guess content | Source / Reason | Status |
|----------|--------------------|----|--------|
| `[chunk:section]` | [Summary of best guess] | [from-code: heuristic / from-sdd: not specified] | [Open / Verified / Replaced] |

## 18.3 Medium-Confidence Inferences (Confirm)

| Location | Inferred content | Source / Reason | Status |
|----------|------------------|----|--------|
| `[chunk:section]` | [Summary of inference] | [from-code: pattern detection / from-sdd: CLAUDE.md default applied] | [Open / Confirmed / Edited] |

## 18.4 Decisions Pending

<!-- Every open decision carries the author's recommended option AND the reason behind it - the stakeholder decides with a default in hand, never from a blank slate. -->

| ID | Decision needed | Recommended option | Why | Stakeholder | Blocking? | Target date |
|----|-----------------|--------------------|-----|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| OQ-01 | [Decision] | [The suggested choice] | [Reason it wins: evidence + tradeoff accepted] | [Role / Person] | [Yes / No] | [YYYY-MM-DD] |
