## Mode Summary

> **How to read this LLD given its mode:**
>
> - **`from-code`** — every section was reverse-engineered from existing source. Structural claims (class names, schemas, topics) are high-confidence; semantic claims (rationale, intent) are medium-confidence unless cross-validated.
> - **`from-sdd`** — every section was forward-designed from the SDD (and CLAUDE.md defaults). Treat as a build target for the implementer. Patterns are proposals annotated with their triggering CLAUDE.md rule.
> - **`hybrid`** — sections are unified across SDD intent and code reality. Drift markers (`⚠`, `🆕`, `⛔`) call out divergences. See `15-open-questions.md` for the drift index.
> - **`partial`** — code exists for some services; others are SDD-described placeholders.
