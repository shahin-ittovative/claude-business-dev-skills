PART OF: LLD - [Project Name]
PURPOSE: Navigation graph for AI implementers and human readers. Each node links to a self-describing chunk. Load this file first, then follow links to the chunks you need.
VERSIONING: All chunks share the LLD version number. When any chunk is updated, bump the LLD version in this master and in the updated chunk(s).
MAINTENANCE: When adding or removing services (especially 04-implementation/<service>.md files), update the tables below, the dependency graph, and the reading-order table.

# LLD Master Index - [Project Name]

> **How to use:** This file is the entry point for the Low-Level Design Document. Each section below maps to a chunk file containing the full template content. Links are relative to this directory. An AI agent should load this file first, identify which chunk(s) are relevant to the task, and navigate to only those chunks.

> **Mode:** [from-code | from-sdd | hybrid | partial]
>
> **Project Type:** [Greenfield | Brownfield] (recorded in [17-specs.md](./17-specs.md) § 4; resolved from the SDD at intake)
>
> **Tech Stack snapshot:** [Backend / Frontend / Mobile / Data / Messaging — canonical copy in [17-specs.md](./17-specs.md) § 2, consolidated from SDD `02-ecosystem-overview.md`]
>
> **Related SDD:** See [../sdd-[project-slug]/sdd-master.md](../sdd-[project-slug]/sdd-master.md) (if applicable).
>
> **Related BRD:** See [../brd-[project-slug]/brd-master.md](../brd-[project-slug]/brd-master.md) (if applicable).
>
> **Specs:** [17-specs.md](./17-specs.md) — owned by this LLD (Mission, Tech Stack, Roadmap, Project Type), synthesised from the SDD after the body; the direct input for speckit `/constitution`. (Legacy chains carried a Specs at `../sdd-[project-slug]/15-specs.md` or `../brd-[project-slug]/12-specs.md` — consumed as input if present.)

## Confidence & Drift Marker Legend

| Marker | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `> Confirm:` | Medium-confidence inference. Reviewer should verify but content is usable. |
| `> TODO: <best-guess> — verify` | Low-confidence inference. Reviewer must verify or replace. |
| `✅` (implicit, no marker) | Aligned: from-code and from-sdd match (hybrid mode only). |
| `⚠ drift` | Hybrid only: SDD intent and code reality disagree. See `> Drift note:` block. |
| `🆕 code-only` | Hybrid only: present in code, not in SDD. |
| `⛔ sdd-only` | Hybrid only: in SDD, not yet built. |

All flags are indexed in [15-open-questions.md](./15-open-questions.md).

### Reading Order by Task

| Agent / Reader Task | Start With | Then |
|---------------------|-----------|------|

| Understand a workflow | 04-implementation/[svc].md (workflows section) | 07, 08 |
| Add a new API endpoint | 06 | 04-implementation/[svc].md, 09 |
| Add a new event | 07 | 04-implementation/[svc].md (event-publishing service) |
| Verify a design pattern | 04-implementation/[svc].md (Design Patterns) | (linked CLAUDE.md rule) |
| Audit drift (hybrid only) | 15 | grep `⚠`, `🆕`, `⛔` across the LLD |
| Plan migration / DB change | 05 | 04-implementation/[svc].md (DB-touching service) |
| Plan a runbook | 10 | 12, 11 |
| Write tests | 13 | 04-implementation/[svc].md, 06, 07 |

### Cross-Document Navigation (BRD ↔ SDD ↔ LLD)

| SDD Chunk | Related LLD Chunk | Relationship |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|
| sdd/04 - Architecture Style | lld/03 - Architecture | SDD names the style; LLD operationalises with concrete component topology |
| sdd/05 - Workflows & Sequences | lld/04-implementation/[svc].md (workflows) | SDD describes the cross-service flow; LLD refines per service with idempotency, outbox, saga steps |
| sdd/07 - Cross-Cutting Concerns | lld/09 - Cross-Cutting | SDD sets defaults; LLD applies them concretely with Resilience4j config, error codes |
| sdd/10 - Centralized Event Hub | lld/07 - Event Contracts | SDD's contract registry (topics, events, payloads) carries verbatim into the LLD's event contracts |
| sdd/10a - Service Detailed Spec | lld/04-implementation/[svc].md | SDD defines the contract; LLD defines the implementation (classes, patterns, pseudocode) |
| sdd/11 - Centralized User Roles | lld/11 - Security + lld/09 - Cross-Cutting | SDD's role/permission catalogue carries verbatim into authZ decisions and checks |
| sdd/12 - Performance & Capacity | lld/12 - Performance | SDD lists targets; LLD describes the caching/index strategy that meets them |
| sdd/14 - Operations Runbook | lld/10 - Operations | SDD describes procedures; LLD links to runbook URLs and exposes the metrics/logs they reference |
| sdd/16 - E2E System Design | lld/02 - Context | SDD's reconciled system map orients the LLD's cross-service dependency view |
