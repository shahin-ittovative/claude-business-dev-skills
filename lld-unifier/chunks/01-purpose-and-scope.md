# 1. Purpose

<!-- One paragraph. What does this LLD enable a developer (or AI implementer) to do that they could not do with only the SDD? Lead with the implementation outcome. -->

[Purpose statement.]

## 2.2 Out of Scope

> **From-sdd note:** scope here is the implementation scope. It may be narrower than the SDD scope if some SDD-described services are not yet being built in this LLD pass.

> **Hybrid note:** if scope diverges between SDD and code, the divergence is marked here with a `⚠ drift` block, and the resolved scope is what the LLD covers.
