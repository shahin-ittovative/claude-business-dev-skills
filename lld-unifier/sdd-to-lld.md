# SDD → LLD Field Mapping (FROM-SDD direction)

This file defines how to derive a Low-Level Design from a Solution Design Document. It is the equivalent of `brd-to-sdd.md` in `sdd-unifier`, but one stage further down the chain: SoW → BRD → SDD → **LLD**.

The default workflow shape is **SoW → BRD → SDD → LLD**, with one LLD per SDD.

---

## One fact, one home (no duplication)

Every fact has exactly one owning document and section. The LLD **references** SDD content — it never restates it:

1. **Reference + delta, never copy.** Design-level content (scope, assumptions, glossary, NFR targets, ADRs, principles) stays in the SDD. The LLD section links to the owning SDD chunk (`../sdd-[project-slug]/NN-....md` § heading) and adds ONLY the implementation-level delta.
2. **Contract names must match; contract bodies are not restated.** Topic names, event names, and role/permission tokens in the LLD match SDD §14/§16 character-for-character (that is consistency, not duplication). Payload contracts and role catalogues are NOT copied — the LLD references SDD §14.9 / §16 (or the schema registry) and adds only implementation detail: consumer groups, serialization, DLQ config, retry policy, enforcement points.
3. **Derived views declare their source.** The LLD's §6.3 Runtime Stack and §15 SLO rows are views of SDD §6/§17 — each row keeps its Source column pointing at the SDD; a value that disagrees with the SDD is drift to flag, never a silent local truth.
4. **Scalar facts live once.** Version pins, targets, and counts are owned upstream (SDD §6/§17) or by the LLD's own Specs chunk — referenced everywhere else.
5. **Restated upstream content is a review defect.** The reviewer flags it as Type `Duplication` with the reference-based rewrite as the Recommendation.
6. **Standalone export is the only exception.** When the user explicitly asks for a self-contained LLD for distribution, the merge step MAY inline referenced SDD sections — marked `> Inlined from SDD §X for standalone distribution`.

## Specs ownership & synthesis (this skill owns the Specs chunk)

The constitution-grade `Specs` (Mission, Tech Stack, Roadmap, Project Type) is **owned by `lld-unifier`** and lives with the LLD as chunk `17-specs.md` (combined: `# 20. Specs`). It is synthesised AFTER the LLD body from the SDD, per SKILL.md § Specs synthesis:

| Specs sub-section | Synthesised from | Consumed by |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Mission** | SDD §1 Executive Summary (2-3 sentences, core idea only) | speckit `/constitution` |
| **2. Tech Stack** | SDD §6 Ecosystem Overview — verbatim with version pins, one bullet per tier | speckit `/constitution` + this skill's `pattern-rules.md` (stack-appropriate pattern selection) + the LLD's own §0 "Tech Stack snapshot" and §6.3 Runtime Stack |
| **3. Roadmap** | SDD §13 services (and the BRD use cases each owns) grouped into 3-6 delivery phases | speckit `/constitution` + delivery planning |
| **4. Project Type** | SDD §1 (recorded at SDD intake) or asked here if absent | The direction decision (see `transform-detection.md`): greenfield → from-sdd; brownfield → from-code / hybrid |

Tech Stack and Project Type are also **inputs to LLD generation itself** — resolve them from the SDD body FIRST (before generating), then formalise them into the Specs chunk after the body is written.

**Legacy chains:** older SDDs carried the Specs at `../sdd/15-specs.md` / `# 19. Specs`, and pre-restructure BRDs at `../brd/12-specs.md` / `# Specs`. If a legacy Specs exists, consume it as read-only input (its Tech Stack pins win over CLAUDE.md defaults; if it disagrees with SDD §6, flag the drift) and still produce the LLD-owned `17-specs.md` as the canonical copy going forward.

**If no SDD is reachable** (pure from-code direction), synthesise the Specs from the code-derived facts: Mission from the discovered system purpose (flag `> Confirm:`), Tech Stack from the actual dependencies (high confidence), Roadmap `Not applicable — reverse-engineered LLD`, Project Type Brownfield.

## What derivation IS

- Reading the SDD in full (and BRD if linked).
- Auto-filling LLD sections that have direct SDD analogues (Bounded Context, Architecture overview, Data Model skeleton, API endpoints, Event topics).
- Applying CLAUDE.md design rules aggressively per `pattern-rules.md` (constructor injection, records DTOs, idempotency on money writes, outbox for state changes, sagas for cross-service, Resilience4j, multi-tenant indexes, RFC 9457 errors, OpenAPI versioning, Flyway migrations).
- Producing a per-service implementation chunk (`04-implementation/<service>.md`) that is **implementation-ready** for an AI implementer to pick up.
- Flagging gaps with `> Confirm: ...` (medium confidence) or `> TODO: <best-guess> — verify` (low confidence).

## What derivation IS NOT

- Inventing class names that aren't implied by the SDD or by CLAUDE.md naming conventions.
- Inventing performance numbers from thin air. SLO targets carry from SDD §17; if the SDD didn't pin them, the LLD flags them.
- Inventing concrete OpenAPI schemas if the SDD didn't pin request / response shapes. The LLD proposes shapes per CLAUDE.md REST conventions and flags them for confirmation.
- Producing complete pseudocode for every method. Only non-trivial methods get pseudocode; CRUD methods are described by signature alone.

## Detecting SDD input form

The SDD can arrive in two forms:

### Chunked form (sdd-unifier output)

Recognise it by:

- Folder path matches `sdd-*/`.
- Contains files named `00-cover-and-changelog.md`, `01-executive-summary-scope-risks.md`, `02-ecosystem-overview.md`, `03-users-and-use-cases.md`, `04-architecture-style-and-diagrams.md`, `05-workflows-and-sequences.md`, `06-principles-and-decisions.md`, `07-cross-cutting-concerns.md`, `08-integrations.md`, `09-services-summary.md`, `10-events-hub.md`, `10a-service-*.md` (one per service), `11-centralized-user-roles.md`, `16-e2e-system-design.md`, etc. (Legacy chunked SDDs lack chunks 10/11/16 and may carry `15-specs.md` — same logical reading order.)
- Each file begins with `<!-- CHUNK: NN ... PART OF: SDD — ... -->`.

**Reading order:** numeric (00, 01, 02, …), with multi-letter chunks read alphabetically within their numeric prefix.

**Treat as one logical SDD.** Read all chunks first, build a unified mental map, then write one LLD.

### Combined form (single SDD .md file)

Recognise by `SDD-` filename prefix or matching template structure.

Read in full before writing anything.

## Field mapping table

This is the authoritative mapping. Each row says: SDD source section → LLD destination chunk + transformation note.

| SDD section | LLD destination | Transformation note |
|---|---|---|
| 00 Cover & Changelog | `00-metadata.md` | New LLD has its own version (v1.0). Add a "Related SDD" line pointing at the SDD's filename / chunk folder. New Changes Log entry: "Initial LLD draft, derived from SDD v[X.X] via lld-unifier. Mode: from-sdd." |
| 01 Executive Summary | `01-purpose-and-scope.md` § 1 Purpose | Recast as **implementation-purpose** statement: what the LLD enables a developer to do (not the technical-summary framing of the SDD). |
| 01 Scope (In/Out) | `01-purpose-and-scope.md` § 2 Scope | **Reference + delta.** Link SDD §2; state only the LLD's narrowing (which services/sub-scope this LLD covers) and implementation-level exclusions. |
| 01 Assumptions | `01-purpose-and-scope.md` § 3 Assumptions | **Reference + delta.** Link SDD §3; list ONLY LLD-specific implementation assumptions. |
| 01 Risks | (Not directly carried — surface in `15-open-questions.md` if any risk affects implementation choices) | The LLD does not duplicate the SDD risk register. |
| 01 Glossary | `01-purpose-and-scope.md` § 4 Glossary | **Reference + delta.** Link SDD §5 (which itself links the BRD glossary); list ONLY LLD-specific terms (pattern names, transaction-policy names, class-suffix conventions). |
| 02 Ecosystem Overview | `03-architecture.md` § 6.3 Runtime Stack | **Derived view with declared source.** The runtime stack table keeps its Source column pointing at SDD §6 rows; a pin that disagrees with SDD §6 is drift to flag, not a local override. |
| 03 Actors / Use Cases | (Implicit — informs `04-implementation/<service>.md` § 7.8 Use Case Workflows naming) | Each use case becomes a `### UC-NN` block in the owning service's file. |
| 04 Architecture Style | `03-architecture.md` § 6.4 Architectural Style — As Operationalised | The LLD doesn't restate the style; it operationalises it (concrete topic naming convention, schema registry choice, outbox-table convention, saga style per case). |
| 04 Context Diagram | `02-context.md` § 5.4 Cross-Service Dependencies | Convert to a Mermaid `graph LR` showing services + external systems. Optional Miro link if the SDD's Context Diagram is on Miro. |
| 04 High-Level Architecture | `03-architecture.md` § 6.1 Component Topology | Convert to Mermaid `graph TB`. |
| 05 Workflows | `04-implementation/<service>.md` § 7.8 Use Case Workflows (per service) | The SDD describes flows at system level; the LLD refines per service with idempotency points, outbox emission points, retry/timeout choices, sequence diagrams (Mermaid). |
| 05 Sequence Diagrams | `04-implementation/<service>.md` § 7.8 (sequence subsection per use case) | Convert to inline Mermaid `sequenceDiagram`. Optional Miro link if the SDD's diagram is on Miro. |
| 06 Architecture Principles | (Inherited — referenced from `03-architecture.md`) | The LLD doesn't restate principles; it follows them. |
| 06 Architectural Decisions (ADRs) | `16-references.md` § 19.2 (cross-link only) | The LLD links to ADRs but doesn't duplicate them. |
| 07 Cross-Cutting Concerns | `09-cross-cutting.md` (entire chunk) | Each SDD default expands into the concrete LLD configuration: e.g., "Multi-tenancy: schema-per-tenant for high-volume" → `09-cross-cutting.md` § 12.1 + concrete index strategy in `05-data-model.md` § 8.4. |
| 08 Integrations | `06-api-contracts.md` (downstream REST) + `07-event-contracts.md` (downstream events) + `04-implementation/<svc>.md` (per-service Resilience4j config in `09-cross-cutting.md` § 12.3) | Each integration row becomes either an outbound API call (with timeout, retry, circuit breaker config) or an event subscription. |
| 09 Services Decomposition (§13) | `lld-master.md` (table of services) + one `04-implementation/<service>.md` file per row | This is **the** structural mapping: one SDD service = one LLD per-service file. |
| 10 Centralized Event Hub (§14) | `07-event-contracts.md` (topic inventory + producer/consumer implementation specs) + `09-cross-cutting.md` (outbox/inbox, delivery guarantees) | **Names match; bodies are referenced.** Topic and event names must match SDD §14 character-for-character. Payload contracts are NOT restated — each event row links to its SDD §14.9 contract (or the schema registry) and the LLD adds only implementation detail: consumer group naming, serialization, DLQ config, retry/redrive policy. |
| 11 Centralized User Roles (§16) | `11-security.md` (authZ decisions) + `09-cross-cutting.md` § auth/tenant + per-service § 7.7 (authorization checks) | **Names match; catalogue is referenced.** Role names and permission tokens must match SDD §16 character-for-character, but the catalogue/matrix is not restated — the LLD references SDD §16 and adds only the enforcement implementation; the implementation seed (§16.12) becomes the role/permission migration + fixture plan. |
| 16 E2E System Design (§22) | `02-context.md` § 5.4 Cross-Service Dependencies + saga narratives in `04-implementation/<orchestrator>.md` | The reconciled fan-out map and saga views orient the per-service derivation; sync one-hop edges (§22.7) become outbound API calls with resilience config. |
| 10a (per service) Boundaries | `04-implementation/<svc>.md` § 7.1 Responsibility | Reframe from boundary statement to responsibility statement. |
| 10a Input | `06-api-contracts.md` (REST inbound) + `07-event-contracts.md` (event consumers) | Inbound REST and event consumers each become rows in the contracts chunks; cross-referenced from the per-service file. |
| 10a Business Logic | `04-implementation/<svc>.md` § 7.2 Class & Interface Map + § 7.3 Method Pseudocode + § 7.4 Design Patterns Applied | The SDD's business-logic prose becomes the LLD's class/interface map and pattern application. **This is the heaviest derivation step.** |
| 10a State Machine (Business Logic subsection) | `08-state-and-rules.md` § 11.1 Aggregate State Machines | Convert to Mermaid `stateDiagram-v2`. |
| 10a Output | `06-api-contracts.md` (REST outbound) + `07-event-contracts.md` (event producers) | Same as Input but for outputs. |
| 10a Integrations (per service) | `04-implementation/<svc>.md` (cross-reference to `06-api-contracts.md` outbound calls) + Resilience4j config in `09-cross-cutting.md` § 12.3 | |
| 10a DB Modeling | `05-data-model.md` § 8.2 Tables (in this service's schema) + § 8.3 Indexes + § 8.5 Migration Plan + § 8.6 Retention & Archival + § 8.7 Encryption | Direct lift; the SDD's ERD becomes the LLD's Mermaid `erDiagram`. |
| 10a Multi-Tenancy Specifications | `05-data-model.md` § 8.4 Multi-Tenancy Strategy (per-service row) | |
| 10a API Standards + List of APIs | `06-api-contracts.md` § 9.1 Endpoint Inventory + § 9.2 Request/Response Shapes + § 9.5 OpenAPI snippets | Per-service endpoint table; OpenAPI generation is downstream (LLD references `[path/openapi.yaml]` and lists snippets). |
| 10a Event Model + Messaging Infra | `07-event-contracts.md` § 10.1 Topic Inventory + § 10.2 Event Schemas + § 10.3 Producer Specs + § 10.4 Consumer Specs | Per-topic detail. Cross-check against SDD §14 (the contract registry) — a divergence between a per-service Event Model and §14 is flagged as drift, never silently resolved. |
| 10a Constraints | `04-implementation/<svc>.md` § 7.7 Error Handling (constraints that surface as exceptions) + `09-cross-cutting.md` (constraints that are platform rules) | |
| 10a Error Handling | `04-implementation/<svc>.md` § 7.7 Error Handling (per-exception RFC 9457 mapping) | Each error becomes a row in the per-service error table. |
| 10a Observability | `10-operations.md` § 13.3 Metrics (per-service custom metrics) | |
| 10a Developer Notes | `04-implementation/<svc>.md` § 7.4 Design Patterns Applied + `13-testing.md` § 16 (test strategy) | |
| 10a Service-Level Diagrams (Flow Chart, Sequence) | `04-implementation/<svc>.md` § 7.8 Use Case Workflows (Mermaid sequence per use case) | |
| 10a Compliance | `11-security.md` § 14.6 Compliance | |
| 10a Deployment Strategy | `03-architecture.md` § 6.2 Deployment Topology (per-service replicas / strategy if overrides exist) | |
| 10a Future Enhancements | (Carried — surface in `15-open-questions.md` § 18.4 Decisions Pending if any inform near-term implementation) | |
| 12 Performance & Capacity (§17) | `12-performance.md` (entire chunk) | **Reference + delta.** SLO rows reference the owning SDD §17 target (per-row link); the LLD adds ONLY the *meeting-the-targets* detail (caching, hot-path indexes, bulkhead sizes). |
| 13 Environments (§18) | `10-operations.md` § 13.1 Configuration | Per-environment config rows. |
| 14 Operations Runbook (§19) | `10-operations.md` § 13.8 Runbook Procedures | The SDD's runbook procedures carry; the LLD enriches with concrete commands once code exists. From SDD alone, runbook procedures may be skeleton-form with `> TODO: concrete commands once code exists — verify`. |
| 15 Appendix (§20) | `16-references.md` (entire chunk) | Carry references; add LLD-specific rows. |

## LLD-only sections (always need architect / SDD-blind input)

These sections have no direct SDD analogue and always produce `> TODO: <best-guess> — verify` markers when deriving from SDD alone:

### `04-implementation/<service>.md` § 7.2 Class & Interface Map (concrete names)

The SDD describes business logic; class names are an implementation choice. Apply CLAUDE.md naming defaults:

- Controllers: `<Domain>Controller`
- Service interfaces: `<Domain>Service`
- Service impls: `<Domain>ServiceImpl`
- Repositories: `<Domain>Repository`
- Domain types: records (CLAUDE.md), suffixed `Dto` (inbound), `Response` (outbound), or unsuffixed (entity).

Flag with `> Confirm: class names follow CLAUDE.md conventions; verify with team`.

### `04-implementation/<service>.md` § 7.3 Method-Level Pseudocode

Only non-trivial methods get pseudocode. The SDD's `Business Logic → How` paragraphs seed the pseudocode. Flag low-confidence inferences with `> TODO: <pseudocode best-guess> — verify with FR-NN`.

### `04-implementation/<service>.md` § 7.6 Transaction Boundaries

Defaults per CLAUDE.md (constructor injection, `@Transactional` REQUIRED, READ_COMMITTED). Per-method overrides require code-or-architect input — flag with `> Confirm: transaction propagation default applied; verify per method`.

### `06-api-contracts.md` § 9.2 Request / Response Shapes

The SDD's "List of APIs" gives method + path + summary. Concrete request / response shapes need either OpenAPI source or architect input — propose a shape per CLAUDE.md REST conventions (records, validation annotations) and flag.

### `12-performance.md` § 15.2 Caching Strategy

The SDD names hot-path concerns; the LLD chooses the cache. From SDD alone, propose a cache only if a SDD performance target requires one (e.g., GET p99 < 50ms with 1000 RPS implies a cache). Otherwise: `> TODO: caching strategy — verify`.

### `12-performance.md` § 15.5 Peak Scenarios

Carry from SDD §17.3 if pinned; otherwise: `> TODO: peak scenarios — verify with SDD §17.3`.

### `14-frontend.md` (if applicable)

The SDD's UI/UX expectations seed the frontend chunk. Concrete component tree, signal/store boundaries, PrimeNG component selections need either existing code or architect input — propose per CLAUDE.md frontend defaults and flag.

## Workflow when deriving from SDD

1. **Detect the SDD form** (chunked / combined) per "Detecting SDD input form" above.
2. **Read the SDD in full.** Numeric order for chunks, end-to-end for combined.
3. **Read the BRD if linked** (only for purpose / scope / glossary supplementary content).
4. **Build a unified mental map.** What's the system? What services exist? What patterns are pinned? What are the performance targets?
5. **Walk the field mapping table** above, filling each LLD chunk.
6. **Apply CLAUDE.md design rules** per `pattern-rules.md`. Every applied pattern carries the triggering rule + rationale.
7. **Generate `04-implementation/<service>.md`** per service. This is the heaviest work.
8. **Apply confidence rules** per `confidence-rules.md`. Every inference carries `> Confirm:` (medium) or `> TODO: <best-guess> — verify` (low).
9. **Index every flag** in `15-open-questions.md`.
10. **Write output** per the chosen shape (chunks / combined).
11. **Synthesise the Specs chunk** (`17-specs.md`) per § Specs ownership & synthesis above and SKILL.md § Specs synthesis.
12. **Surface a structured handoff summary**: file paths, chunk count, service count, pattern application count, confidence flag counts (high / medium / low), Specs status.
