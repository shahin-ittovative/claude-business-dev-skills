# Hybrid Mode — Two-Pass Drift Detection

This file defines the diff logic for hybrid direction: when both an SDD and complete code are available, the skill produces a unified LLD with inline drift markers showing where design intent diverges from code reality.

The output is a **single unified LLD**, not separate `designed/` and `built/` folders. Drift is surfaced inline.

---

## Marker grammar

Every section in the unified LLD is one of:

| Marker | Meaning | Content shape |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| (none / `✅` implicit) | Aligned: from-sdd and from-code agree. | Single content block. |
| `⚠ drift` | Design and code disagree. | Reconciled content + `> Drift note: SDD says X, code does Y. [resolution suggestion]` |
| `🆕 code-only` | Present in code, not in SDD. | Code-derived content + `> Drift note: present in code, not in SDD. [Backfill SDD or remove from code?]` |
| `⛔ sdd-only` | In SDD, not yet built. | SDD-derived content + `> Drift note: in SDD, not yet built. [Schedule implementation or defer?]` |

> Note: per the user's CLAUDE.md, emoji glyphs in chat are restricted, but inside generated LLD content they are functional markers (explicitly chosen via decision #5). If preferred, the skill can emit `[ALIGNED]`, `[DRIFT]`, `[CODE-ONLY]`, `[SDD-ONLY]` as text markers — see SKILL.md insight.

## Two-pass workflow

### Pass 1 — From-SDD (in memory)

Run the FROM-SDD workflow per `sdd-to-lld.md`. Produce per-section "designed" content. Do NOT write to disk yet.

### Pass 2 — From-code (in memory)

Run the FROM-CODE workflow per `code-extraction.md`. Produce per-section "built" content. Do NOT write to disk yet.

### Pass 3 — Diff and unify

For each chunk and each subsection within the chunk, classify into one of four cases:

#### Case A: Both passes produced content; content matches semantically

Emit a single content block (no marker). The skill considers the section *aligned*.

> **Match definition:** for tabular content (endpoint inventory, topic inventory, table schema), match means same row keys with same values. For prose content (narrative, rationale), match means semantic equivalence (paraphrase OK, contradictory facts NOT OK).

#### Case B: Both passes produced content; content differs

Emit reconciled content + `⚠ drift` marker. Reconciliation rule:

- For factual content (schema, topics, endpoints): emit the **code** as the live state, plus a `> Drift note: SDD says X, code does Y.` Code is the truth-by-default for current state.
- For rationale / narrative content: emit the **SDD** rationale (which captures design intent) + `> Drift note: code reflects this differently — see [chunk:section-X] for the as-built behaviour.`
- For pattern application: emit both, attributing each to its source: `Designed: [pattern X per CLAUDE.md rule Y]. Built: [different pattern, or simpler/more-complex variant].`

#### Case C: Only from-code produced content; from-sdd was silent

Emit code-derived content + `🆕 code-only` marker + `> Drift note: present in code, not in SDD. Backfill SDD or remove?`

Common cases:
- A helper service exists in code that isn't named in the SDD's service decomposition.
- An additional Kafka topic exists for an internal optimisation not described in the SDD.
- A method on a controller that supports a feature flagged at the API gateway and not in the SDD's API list.

#### Case D: Only from-sdd produced content; code is silent

Emit SDD-derived content + `⛔ sdd-only` marker + `> Drift note: in SDD, not yet built. Schedule or defer?`

Common cases:
- A service the SDD lists in §13.1 but the codebase has no module for.
- An event topic the SDD describes but no producer code exists for.
- An API endpoint the SDD lists but the controller doesn't have it.

## Section-by-section diff rules

### `00-metadata.md`

- Mode field is `hybrid`.
- Changes Log entry: "Hybrid LLD generated; N drift markers, M code-only, K sdd-only — see 15-open-questions.md."

### `01-purpose-and-scope.md`

- Carry SDD content (purpose / scope are design intent, not code).
- Code-only services that aren't in scope per SDD → emit them with `🆕 code-only` flag.

### `02-context.md`

- Bounded context: SDD-derived.
- Cross-service dependency graph: emit the **code** version as live state. Mark services that exist in code but not in SDD with `🆕`. Mark services in SDD but not in code with `⛔` (in the diagram, render with dashed style).

### `03-architecture.md`

- Component topology: emit code as live state; mark drift inline.
- Architectural style: emit SDD as designed; mark `⚠ drift` if code's actual operationalisation differs (e.g., SDD says event-driven, code uses synchronous chained REST calls).

### `04-implementation/<service>.md`

This is where most drift will surface.

- Per-service file is generated only if the service exists in either source.
- If service exists in both: full hybrid content with subsection-level drift.
- If only in code: full code-derived content with `🆕 code-only` at the top.
- If only in SDD: stub with full SDD-derived class skeleton + `⛔ sdd-only` at the top.

Subsection-level drift inside a per-service file:
- Class & Interface Map: emit code as live state; flag classes the SDD doesn't reference (`🆕`); flag SDD-described classes that aren't built (`⛔`).
- Design Patterns Applied: critical drift surface. SDD says Strategy, code uses if/else chain → `⚠ drift` with both views.
- Use-Case Workflows: similar drift surface for missing/extra steps.

### `05-data-model.md`

- ERD: emit code as live state.
- Tables: per-table comparison. Missing tables `⛔`, extra tables `🆕`, schema mismatches `⚠ drift`.
- Indexes: per-index comparison.

### `06-api-contracts.md`

- Endpoint inventory: per-endpoint comparison. Missing endpoints `⛔`, extra endpoints `🆕`, schema/auth mismatches `⚠ drift`.

### `07-event-contracts.md`

- Topic inventory: per-topic comparison. Same rules.

### `08-state-and-rules.md`

- State machines: emit code as live state if state machine is implemented; mark drift if SDD shows different states/transitions.

### `09-cross-cutting.md`

- Per concern: SDD specifies the default; code implements. Compare per-row.
- Idempotency on money writes: code MUST implement (CLAUDE.md hard rule). If SDD says yes and code doesn't → `⚠ drift` flagged HIGH severity.
- Outbox pattern: same — hard rule, missing outbox is HIGH severity drift.

### `10-operations.md`

- Config / metrics / logs / tracing: emit code as live state.
- Runbook procedures: emit SDD's skeleton + flag with `> Confirm: procedure described in SDD; verify against current code commands`.

### `11-security.md`

- Data classification: SDD-derived (intent).
- PII inventory: emit code as live state — drift here is HIGH severity (PII handled differently than SDD specified is a compliance risk).
- Compliance: SDD-derived; flag drift if code lacks an enforcement point the SDD describes.

### `12-performance.md`

- SLO targets: SDD-derived.
- Caching strategy: emit code as live state. Drift if SDD specifies a cache the code doesn't have.
- Hot-path indexes: emit code as live state. Drift if SDD-recommended indexes are missing.

### `13-testing.md`

- Test pyramid: emit code as live state.
- Coverage: emit code measurements (if available) vs SDD-stated targets.

### `14-frontend.md` (if applicable)

- Component tree: emit code as live state.
- Pattern drift: emit per-component diffs.

### `15-open-questions.md`

This is the **drift index** — every drift marker placed elsewhere has a row here.

| Location | Marker | Severity | Resolution |
|----------|--------|----------|------------|
| `04-implementation/wallet-core.md § 7.4 Pattern: Outbox` | `⚠ drift` | HIGH | SDD requires outbox; code does direct Kafka publish in same method as DB write. Reconcile by introducing outbox table + publisher. |
| `04-implementation/wallet-core.md § 7.2` | `🆕 code-only` | LOW | Class `LegacyAdapter` exists in code but not in SDD. Investigate origin. |
| `04-implementation/notification-dispatcher.md` | `⛔ sdd-only` | MEDIUM | Service in SDD §13.1 not yet built. |

### `16-references.md`

- Carry SDD references; add code-derived references (repo URL, commit SHA at time of analysis).

## Severity ranking for drift markers

| Severity | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **HIGH** | Missing outbox pattern, missing idempotency on money endpoints, PII handling drift, multi-tenancy enforcement gap, RFC 9457 error model not implemented, SDD-mandated saga not implemented in cross-service flow. |
| **MEDIUM** | Different design pattern than SDD specified (but functionally equivalent), missing Resilience4j config on a downstream call, additional un-described Kafka topic, test coverage gap. |
| **LOW** | Naming difference, additional helper class without business meaning, documentation gap, ordering of fields in DTOs. |

The severity is recorded in `15-open-questions.md` § 18.1. The skill computes a default severity per drift type; the reviewer can edit.

## When the diff is genuinely ambiguous

Some sections cannot be cleanly diffed (e.g., a free-form rationale paragraph). For these:

- Emit **SDD's version** as the designed intent.
- Emit **code's observed behaviour** as a `> Drift note: code does X — verify whether intentional drift or unimplemented requirement`.
- Severity: MEDIUM by default; reviewer can edit.

Never silently merge two contradictory paragraphs. The whole point of hybrid mode is to surface drift, not paper over it.
