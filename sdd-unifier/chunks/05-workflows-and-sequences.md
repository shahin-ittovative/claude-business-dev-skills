## 8.4 Workflow Diagrams

<!-- This chunk continues the System Design section from chunk 04 (Architecture Style & Diagrams). -->
<!-- Add one workflow per critical end-to-end business flow. Inline Mermaid is the default diagram medium; each diagram gets a 1-2 sentence prose Summary so it reads without rendering. Append `> Miro: <url>` only if a richer whiteboard version exists on a real board. -->

### 8.4.1 Workflow: [Flow Name]

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Step 1] --> B[Step 2]
  B --> C[Step 3]
  C --> D[Step 4]
```

**Summary:** [1-2 sentences describing the flow in prose.]

### 8.4.2 Workflow: [Flow Name]

<!-- Repeat for each critical workflow. -->

## 8.5 Sequence Diagrams

<!-- Add one sequence diagram per critical interaction (sync + async). -->

### 8.5.1 Sequence: [Flow Name]

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant P1 as Participant 1
  participant P2 as Participant 2
  P1->>P2: [message]
  P2-->>P1: [response]
```

**Summary:** [1-2 sentences describing the interaction in prose.]

### 8.5.2 Sequence: [Flow Name]

<!-- Repeat for each critical sequence. -->
