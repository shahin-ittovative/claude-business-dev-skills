# 6. Ecosystem Overview

<!--
Summary of the platform-wide technology stack and shared infrastructure that all services in this SDD must conform to.
This section is the single source of truth for the implementation constitution and planned technology choices.
SELECTION FLOW: this table is never filled silently. Per SKILL.md § Ecosystem selection, the skill first presents the proposed ecosystem (BRD Technical Inputs verbatim > CLAUDE.md defaults > BRD-informed recommendations) for a one-shot accept-all; if not accepted, it walks the user through the items in grouped batches, highlighting the recommended option per item with the BRD evidence that drives it. Record the outcome per row in the Notes column (e.g., "BRD-mandated", "default accepted", "user override - see ADR-NN").
-->

| Layer | Technology / Service | Version / Tier | Notes |

**Ecosystem-level rules:**

<!-- The first three rules are platform defaults (EDA / DDD / Hexagonal). Keep them unless the user explicitly overrode them during ecosystem selection - an override needs an ADR in §10. -->

- **Event-driven by default (EDA):** every cross-service state change travels as an asynchronous event through the Centralized Event Hub (§14); synchronous REST is reserved for true request-response, capped at one hop. Outbox pattern mandatory - no dual-writes.
- **DDD bounded contexts:** one service owns one bounded context, one database, one team of decisions. No shared schemas across services; the §13 decomposition follows domain boundaries, not technical tiers.
- **Hexagonal architecture (ports & adapters) per service:** domain core isolated from transport and infrastructure; inbound/outbound adapters (REST, messaging, persistence, providers) plug into ports. Provider integrations sit behind anti-corruption adapters.
- [Rule, e.g., timezone - UTC for all datetimes]
- [Rule, e.g., ID strategy - UUIDv7 primary keys]
- [Rule, e.g., service-to-service auth]
- [Rule, e.g., secrets handling]

# 14. Centralized Event Hub (Platform Event Catalog & Payload Contracts)

> **What this chunk is.** The one place that lists **every event on the platform** with its producer, consumers, key family, payload contract, and business meaning (what / when / why), plus the hub topology that carries them. It is a derived consolidation of the per-service Event Models (each `10x` chunk § Event-Driven Architecture). Downstream LLD generation and implementers read this chunk as the single contract surface - the key goal is a smooth implementation with no producer/consumer mismatches.

---

## 14.1 Purpose & Scope

<!--
State the platform's eventing posture in one paragraph (EDA default: every cross-service state change travels as an asynchronous event; synchronous REST reserved for true request-response, capped at one hop).
Then answer four questions for the whole platform:
  1. What events exist (count + producing services)
  2. Who produces and who consumes each (reconciled both ways)
  3. What each event carries (envelope + payload contract)
  4. Why and when each fires (business moment + downstream purpose)
State what is OUT of scope: in-process domain events that never leave a service; provider webhooks (REST callbacks, not bus events); external adapter ingestion edges normalized at an anti-corruption layer before any platform event.
-->

[Eventing posture + the four questions + out-of-scope list.]

## 14.2 Hub Topology Decision

<!--
Name the chosen topology and why (e.g., one logical hub realized as one topic per domain plus shared special-purpose topics, fanning out to one queue per consumer; or a single broker cluster with topic-per-aggregate). State what makes it ONE hub (shared envelope standard, shared messaging library, shared schema registry, shared event archive, one delivery semantic).
Include the tradeoff table for the chosen vs rejected topology.
-->

**Decision:** [One-line topology decision.]

What makes it *one hub* is the shared contract surface:

- **One envelope standard** (§14.3) on every event, on every topic.
- **One messaging library / pattern:** [outbox -> relay -> broker -> inbox, per CLAUDE.md outbox mandate].
- **One schema registry:** [registry + additive-only rule, CI-enforced].
- **One event archive:** [archive destination, subscribed from day one, for replay].
- **One delivery semantic:** at-least-once delivery, exactly-once **effect** via `(consumer, event_id)` inbox dedup, per-aggregate ordering via `aggregate_version`.

| Dimension | [Chosen topology] | [Rejected topology] |
|---|---|---|
| Access control | [Note] | [Note] |
| Blast radius | [Note] | [Note] |
| Archive / replay granularity | [Note] | [Note] |
| Ownership | [Note] | [Note] |
| Cost / fan-out | [Note] | [Note] |

### 14.2.1 Async Backbone (the universal per-event mechanism)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph PROD[Producer service - one bounded context]
      DOM[Domain aggregate write]
      OBX[(Outbox row - same transaction)]
      DOM -- one DB transaction --> OBX
    end
    REL[Relay / publisher]
    OBX -- after commit only --> REL
    REL -- publish envelope --> TOP((Broker topic))
    TOP -- fan-out --> Q1[Queue / group - consumer A]
    TOP -- fan-out --> Q2[Queue / group - consumer B]
    TOP -- archive subscription --> ARC[(Event archive)]
    Q1 --> INB[Inbox dedup on consumer + event_id]
    INB -- first delivery --> APPLY[Apply effect]
    INB -- already processed --> SKIP[Skip - idempotent no-op]
    APPLY -- poison / invalid --> DLQ[(DLQ + alarm + redrive runbook)]
```

### 14.2.2 Hub Topology & Fan-Out Landscape

<!-- Producer -> topic -> consumer shape of the whole platform: structural clusters, not every edge (the full matrix is 14.5). -->

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    P1[Producer service 1] --> T1[[topic-1]]
    P2[Producer service 2] --> T2[[topic-2]]
    T1 --> C1[Consumer service A]
    T1 --> C2[Consumer service B]
    T2 --> C2
```

## 14.3 Standard Event Envelope (every event, every topic)

<!-- Every event carries this envelope; only the payload{} body varies per event. Adjust fields to the project but keep the invariants: unique event id (dedup key), typed past-tense fact, schema version, aggregate identity + monotonic version, UTC timestamp, correlation id, tenant keys, payload body. -->

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `event_id` | UUIDv7 | Globally unique; the inbox dedup key `(consumer, event_id)` -> exactly-once effect. |
| `event_type` | string | SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE, past-tense fact (e.g., `PAYMENT_COMPLETED`). |
| `schema_version` | semver | Schema version from the registry (additive-only). |
| `aggregate_id` | UUIDv7 | The producing aggregate instance. |
| `aggregate_type` | string | The producing aggregate (e.g., `Invoice`). |
| `aggregate_version` | int | Per-aggregate monotonic counter; the ordering / last-writer-wins guard. |
| `occurred_at` | timestamp (UTC) | When the fact happened. |
| `correlation_id` | UUIDv7 | Opaque request/trace correlation; carries no tenant data or PII. |
| `causation_id` | UUIDv7 (optional) | The event that caused this one. |
| `tenant_id` | UUIDv7 | Tenant key. [Adjust to the project's tenancy keys.] |
| `payload{}` | JSON | Event-specific body; schema owned by the registry (§14.9). |

**Key-family variants (if applicable):**

- [Family 1, e.g., tenant-keyed - most domain events.]
- [Family 2, e.g., generic keys for reusable services, mapped at an anti-corruption layer.]
- [Exceptions, each named and justified.]

## 14.4 Topic Registry

<!-- One row per topic. Every topic has exactly ONE owner (sole publisher). Names here are canonical - per-service chunks must use them verbatim. -->

| # | Topic | Owner (sole publisher) | Key family | Phase |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `[project]-[domain]-events` | [Service] | [Key family] | [P1] |
| 2 | `[project]-[domain]-events` | [Service] | [Key family] | [P1] |

**No topic, no published events (consumers only):** [List consumer-only services, e.g., API Gateway, Analytics.]

## 14.5 Platform Event Catalog

<!--
Grouped by producing service / topic - one sub-section per producer, in §13 decomposition order.
Status legend: committed = wired in its phase; candidate = name fixed, no consumer wired until the contract ratifies; Analytics-only = no named domain consumer.
Consumer reconciliation: consumer lists are reconciled from BOTH the producer's published table AND every consumer's consumed table. Where a producer under-lists, show the broader real set and footnote it.
-->

**Status legend:** `committed` / `candidate` / `Analytics-only` / `Pn` = phase.

### 14.5.1 [Producer Service] — `[topic-name]` ([key family]; [phase])

| Event | Consumers | Payload (beyond envelope) | Business: what · when · why | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `[EVENT_NAME]` | [Consumer services] | `[fields beyond the envelope]` | [What fact] · [when it fires] · [why downstream cares] | [committed] |
| `[EVENT_NAME]` | [Consumer services] | `[fields]` | [what · when · why] | [candidate] |

### 14.5.2 [Producer Service] — `[topic-name]` ([key family]; [phase])

| Event | Consumers | Payload (beyond envelope) | Business: what · when · why | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `[EVENT_NAME]` | [Consumer services] | `[fields]` | [what · when · why] | [Status] |

<!-- Repeat 14.5.X per producing service. -->

## 14.6 Cross-Cutting Event Guarantees

<!-- The invariants every edge inherits. Keep as a numbered list, e.g.: -->

1. **Atomicity:** domain state + outbox row commit in one transaction; the relay publishes only after commit (no dual-writes).
2. **Delivery:** at-least-once everywhere; consumers dedup on `(consumer, event_id)`.
3. **Ordering:** per-aggregate via `aggregate_version` (last-writer-wins for projections; validated transitions for state machines) — not broker ordering.
4. **Poison handling:** invalid transitions and undeserializable messages dead-letter with alarm + redrive runbook; never silently dropped.
5. **Schema evolution:** additive-only, registry-enforced; breaking change = new event name.
6. **Replay:** archive -> consumer queue, never archive -> topic.
7. [Project-specific guarantee.]

## 14.7 Universal Subscribers & Cross-Service Doctrines

<!--
Name the broad consumers (e.g., Analytics binds every domain topic; Notification binds the wired delivery set) and any platform doctrines, e.g.:
- Re-publication doctrine: a reusable service's generic fact is consumed ONLY by the initiating service, which re-publishes its own domain fact.
- Shared special-purpose topics and their sole consumers.
-->

- [Universal subscriber 1 + breadth rule.]
- [Universal subscriber 2 + breadth rule.]
- [Doctrine 1, e.g., money-fact re-publication: initiator-only consumption + domain re-publication.]

## 14.8 Consistency Notes & Open Flags

<!--
The reconciliation ledger for producer/consumer consistency. Every divergence found while consolidating the per-service Event Models lands here with a pointer - never silently reconciled. Empty section = full reconciliation achieved; state that explicitly.
-->

| # | Where (chunks) | Divergence | Resolution / flag |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [10x vs this chunk] | [e.g., consumer under-listed / payload field mismatch / topic name drift] | [Fixed in 10x on YYYY-MM-DD / flagged as OI-NN] |

## 14.9 Payload Contract Samples

<!--
Per-event payload contracts in the style of a schema-registry draft. Rules:
  - The envelope (§14.3) is NOT repeated per event - only payload{} fields beyond the envelope.
  - Type vocabulary: uuid, string, int, decimal(p,s), bool, timestamp (UTC ISO-8601), enum{...}, ref(ValueObject), array<T>, map<K,V>.
  - Required column: R = required, O = optional, C = conditional (state the condition in Notes).
  - Status mirrors §14.5.
  - PII fields are tagged `pii` and must appear in the erasure-path mapping.
Define common value objects once, then reference them.
-->

### 14.9.0 Common Value Objects

| Value object | Fields | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `Money` | `amount decimal(19,4)`, `currency string(ISO-4217)` | [events] |
| `[ValueObject]` | [fields] | [events] |

### 14.9.1 `[EVENT_NAME]` — [status]

**Producer:** [service] · **Topic:** `[topic-name]` · **Key family:** [family]

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[field]` | [type] | R | [meaning; `pii` tag if applicable] |
| `[field]` | [type] | O | [meaning] |

<!-- Repeat 14.9.X per event. For large platforms, sample the load-bearing events here and keep the full set in the schema registry; state explicitly which events are registry-only (no silent gaps). -->

### 14.9.99 Coverage Matrix

<!-- One row per event in §14.5: does it have a payload contract here or in the registry? This is the single source of the platform event count. -->

| Event | Catalog (§14.5) | Contract (§14.9 / registry) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[EVENT_NAME]` | ✓ | [§14.9.1 / registry-only] | [committed] |

# 16. Centralized User Roles & Authorities (Platform-Wide)

> **What this chunk is.** The one place that answers: what user types exist, which roles and sub-roles they break into, what each role is allowed to do, who may create or invite whom, and which services each role interacts with. Downstream, the LLD and the identity/authorization implementation seed from this catalogue - the key goal is that authorization behaves identically across every service.

---

## 16.1 Business Overview

<!-- 1-2 paragraphs in plain language: the tiers of users on the platform, the tenancy planes they live in (e.g., platform operator vs tenant company vs end customer), and the business rationale for the split. -->

[Business overview.]

## 16.2 Resolution Model — How a Role Becomes an Allowed Action

<!-- Describe the runtime path from identity to permitted action: token claims -> role/sub-role resolution -> permission lookup -> contextual gates (tenant scope, ownership, module enablement, subscription status). Name where each gate is enforced (edge gateway, authorization service, service-local check). -->

[Resolution model: identity -> role -> permission -> contextual gates, with enforcement points.]

## 16.3 User Types (Tier 1)

| User type | Tenancy plane | Identity source | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[USER_TYPE]` | [Platform / Tenant / End-customer] | [IAM realm / pool] | [Description] |
| `[USER_TYPE]` | [Plane] | [Source] | [Description] |

## 16.4 Role Catalogue — Authorities & Related Services

<!-- One sub-section per Tier-1 user type. Each table: role, scope, core authorities (verbs), related services. -->

### 16.4.1 [User type A] Roles

| Role | Scope | Core authorities | Related services |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[ROLE]` | [company / compound / unit / global] | [What it may do, verb-level] | [Services touched] |

### 16.4.2 [User type B] Sub-Roles

| Sub-role | Scope | Core authorities | Related services |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[SUB_ROLE]` | [Scope] | [Authorities] | [Services] |

### 16.4.3 Platform Plane (operator — outside tenant tenancy)

| Role | Scope | Core authorities | Related services |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[PLATFORM_ROLE]` | global | [Break-glass, provisioning, billing ops, support] | [Services] |

## 16.5 Capability Matrix (canonical)

<!-- The compact capability view: capabilities as rows, roles/sub-roles as columns, Yes / - / footnoted-conditional cells. Conditional footnotes become explicit attribute-based rules (own records only, own unit only, etc.). -->

| Capability | `[ROLE_1]` | `[ROLE_2]` | `[SUB_ROLE_1]` |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Capability] | Yes | - | Yes¹ |

¹ [Condition, e.g., own unit only.]

## 16.6 Grant / Invitation Authority (who can create whom)

| Grantor role | May create / invite | Constraints |
|---|---|---|
| `[ROLE]` | `[ROLE(S)]` | [Scope limits, approval gates, count limits] |

## 16.7 Role → Related-Services Matrix (platform-wide)

<!-- Roles as rows, services as columns; cell = the interaction class (admin / write / read / none). Service names must match §13 decomposition verbatim. -->

| Role | [Service 1] | [Service 2] | [Service 3] |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[ROLE]` | [admin / write / read / -] | [—] | [—] |

## 16.8 Lifecycle, Scope & Revocation Rules

<!-- Numbered rules: how roles are granted at onboarding, how they change, what suspends or revokes them, what happens to in-flight work on revocation, and the erasure path. -->

1. [Grant rule.]
2. [Change rule.]
3. [Suspension / revocation rule + effect on in-flight work.]
4. [Erasure rule.]

## 16.9 Diagrams

### 16.9.1 Role Taxonomy (user types → roles → sub-roles)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  UT1[User type A] --> R1[Role 1]
  UT1 --> R2[Role 2]
  UT2[User type B] --> SR1[Sub-role 1]
  UT2 --> SR2[Sub-role 2]
```

### 16.9.2 Grant / Invitation Authority (who may create whom)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  PLATFORM[Platform operator] -->|provisions| ADMIN[Tenant admin]
  ADMIN -->|invites| R1[Role 1]
  R1 -->|invites| SR1[Sub-role 1]
```

### 16.9.3 Per-Request Authorization (how a role yields a decision)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant C as Client
  participant GW as Edge / Gateway
  participant AZ as Authorization
  participant SVC as Domain service
  C->>GW: request + token
  GW->>GW: [edge gate: issuer, tenant status]
  GW->>SVC: forward + identity context
  SVC->>AZ: evaluate(role, permission, scope)
  AZ-->>SVC: allow / deny
  SVC-->>C: response / 403
```

## 16.10 Traceability

<!-- Map back to the sources: BRD Users & Use Cases Matrix rows, per-service authorization notes (10x chunks), and ADRs that shaped the model. Every capability row must trace to at least one BRD UC or an ADR. -->

| Capability / rule | Source (BRD UC / matrix row / ADR / 10x chunk) |
|---|---|
| [Capability] | [Source ref] |

## 16.11 Permission × Role Matrix (platform-wide)

<!-- The exhaustive grid: one row per permission token (the runtime names services check), one column per role/sub-role. This is the implementation-facing view; §16.5 is the business-facing view. Keep tokens in the exact runtime spelling. -->

| Permission token | `[ROLE_1]` | `[ROLE_2]` | `[SUB_ROLE_1]` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[service].[resource].[action]` | ✓ | - | ✓¹ |

## 16.12 Implementation Seed & Reconciliation

<!-- How this catalogue becomes data: the seed rows for the role/permission store, per-role action counts as a drift baseline, the canonical name-map from grid labels to runtime tokens, and a drift register for divergences found between this chunk, the BRD matrix, and per-service chunks. -->

### 16.12.1 Seed Strategy

[Where the seed lives (migration / fixture), and the update rule when roles change.]

### 16.12.2 Per-Role Action Counts (drift baseline)

| Role | Seeded permission count |
|---|---|
| `[ROLE]` | [N] |

### 16.12.3 Drift & Reconciliation Register

| # | Where | Divergence | Resolution / flag |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [BRD matrix vs 10x vs this chunk] | [Mismatch] | [Fixed on YYYY-MM-DD / flagged as OI-NN] |

# 22. End-to-End System Design (Services · Topics · Producers · Consumers)

> **What this section is.** The bird's-eye, implementation-facing map of the entire platform: the service landscape, the system context, the layered architecture, the full producer → topic → consumer fan-out, the synchronous edges, and the key sagas. A new engineer (or AI implementer) reads this section to understand how the system fits together, following its references into §14/§15/§16 for the normative contracts. One fact, one home: content owned by §14 (mechanism, registry, guarantees, doctrines) is referenced here, never restated.

---

## How to Read This Document

<!-- One short paragraph: reading order of the sections, and what each diagram notation means. -->

[Reading guidance.]

### Counts at a Glance

| Dimension | Count | Source of truth |
|---|---|---|
| Services | [N] | §13 (chunk 09) |
| Topics | [N] | §14.4 (chunk 10) |
| Distinct published events | [N] | §14.9 coverage matrix (chunk 10) |
| Synchronous REST edges | [N] | §22.7 |
| Sagas documented | [N] | §22.8 |

### Faithfulness & Deliberate Simplifications (no silent caps)

<!-- List every simplification made in this chunk's diagrams (e.g., "domain producers clustered into one node in §22.2", "only the 3 load-bearing sagas drawn"). If nothing was simplified, say so. -->

- [Simplification 1 + where the full detail lives.]

## 22.1 Service Landscape (archetype × phase)

<!-- One row per service: archetype (domain / reusable-generic / edge / read-model / orchestrator), phase, key family, sync surface, async surface. Names verbatim from §13. -->

| # | Service | Archetype | Phase | Publishes to | Consumes from | Sync surface |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [service] | [archetype] | [P1] | `[topic]` | `[topics]` | [REST APIs exposed] |

## 22.2 System Context

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  U([Users / actor classes]) --> EDGE[Edge / Gateway]
  EDGE --> PLATFORM[[Platform services]]
  PLATFORM --> EXT1[(External provider 1)]
  PLATFORM --> EXT2[(External provider 2)]
```

## 22.3 Layered High-Level Architecture

```mermaid

  subgraph L1[Edge]
    GW[Gateway]
  end
  subgraph L2[Frontend]
    FE[Apps]
  end
  subgraph L3[Services]
    S1[Service 1]
    S2[Service 2]
  end
  subgraph L4[Data]
    DB[(Databases - one per service)]
  end
  subgraph L5[Async backbone]
    BR[(Broker / topics)]
  end
  FE --> GW --> S1 & S2
  S1 & S2 --> DB
  S1 & S2 -.publish/consume.-> BR
```

## 22.4 The Universal Per-Event Mechanism (async backbone)

<!-- Owned by §14.2.1 - referenced, never restated here. One prose sentence + the pointer. -->

Every event on every topic flows through the one universal mechanism — outbox → relay → topic → per-consumer queue with inbox dedup and DLQ. **Normative definition and diagram: §14.2.1.**

## 22.5 Producer → Topic → Consumer Fan-Out (the event map)

<!-- One sub-section per delivery phase. Each: a Mermaid flowchart of producer -> topic -> consumers for that phase's services. Edge labels name the load-bearing events. The exhaustive matrix stays in §14.5; this is the navigable visual. -->

### 22.5.1 Phase 1 Core

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  S1[Service 1] --> T1[[topic-1]]
  T1 -->|EVENT_A| C1[Consumer 1]
  T1 -->|EVENT_B| C2[Consumer 2]
```

### 22.5.2 Phase 2+ Domains

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  S3[Service 3] --> T3[[topic-3]]
  T3 --> C4[Consumer 4]
```

### 22.5.3 Universal Subscribers (breadth rules)

<!-- Name the broad consumers only (they would clutter every fan-out diagram above); their binding rules are owned by §14.7 - reference, don't restate. -->

- [Universal subscriber — see §14.7 for its binding rule.]

## 22.6 Cross-Service Doctrines

<!-- Name each platform-wide interaction doctrine + a pointer to its normative home (§14.7 / ADR). Names only - the rules are not restated here. -->

1. [Doctrine name — normative home §14.7 / AD-NN.]

## 22.7 Synchronous REST Edges (one-hop rule)

<!-- Every service-to-service synchronous call on the platform. Per CLAUDE.md: no chained REST more than one hop deep. Each row: caller -> callee, purpose, why it must be synchronous. -->

| # | Caller → Callee | Purpose | Why synchronous |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [svc] → [svc] | [Purpose] | [Justification] |

## 22.8 Key Sagas (dynamic view)

<!-- One sub-section per load-bearing cross-service flow: orchestrator (or choreography), participants, happy path, compensation path. Mermaid sequence diagrams. -->

### 22.8.1 [Saga name] ([orchestrated by X / choreographed])

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant O as Orchestrator
  participant A as Service A
  participant B as Service B
  O->>A: step 1
  A--)O: EVENT_A
  O->>B: step 2
  alt failure
    O->>A: compensate
  end
```

## 22.9 Normative References

<!-- Pure pointer section - no tables, no restated rules. One fact, one home. -->

- **Topic registry (one row per topic, owner, key family):** §14.4.
- **Per-event consumer reconciliation:** §14.5; payload contracts: §14.9.
- **Cross-cutting guarantees every edge inherits:** §14.6.
- **Universal subscribers & doctrines:** §14.7.
- **Roles & authorities behind every edge's authorization:** §16.

## Sources

<!-- The chunks this consolidation was built from, with a one-line note per source. -->

# 23. Open Items & Clarifications

> **What this section is.** A structured backlog of architectural concerns identified after the main SDD was authored, by a reviewer running with cleared context. Each item comes with a **Recommended Answer** - a concrete, ready-to-apply resolution. Items are decisions awaiting the architect's acceptance: accept the recommendation (or adjust it), and it gets reflected into the SDD body.
>
> **What this section is not.** It is not a list of inline `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...]` markers found in the body - those remain inline. This section is the reviewer's *external* findings: gaps the body did not mark, scenarios the body did not consider, corner cases the body did not test for, and contract inconsistencies between the centralized catalogues (chunks 10, 11, 16) and the per-service chunks they consolidate.

---

## How to read each item

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **ID** | OI-NN. Stable across revisions. |
| **Where** | Section number (e.g., §6, §15.1), service name, or "global" if cross-cutting. |
| **Type** | Architecture gap / Missing scenario / Corner case / Ambiguity / Risk / Inconsistency / NFR shortfall / ADR needed / Contract mismatch (topic, event, payload, consumer list, or role/permission divergence across chunks) / Duplication (BRD content or another chunk's content restated instead of referenced). |
| **Concern** | One paragraph. What was missed and why it matters for downstream LLD or implementation. |
| **Options** | At least 2 concrete choices, each with a one-line tradeoff. |
| **Recommended Answer** | The reviewer's concrete proposed resolution, written as ready-to-apply SDD content (the exact row, decision, sub-section, or wording that would close the item). This is what gets injected into the body when accepted. |
| **Why** | REQUIRED. One or two lines: the reason the recommended option wins over the alternatives — the evidence behind it (BRD requirement, NFR, doctrine/CLAUDE.md default, operational risk avoided) and the tradeoff being accepted. Never empty, never "best option". |
| **Status** | Open (awaiting decision) / Accepted - applied (with pointer) / Adjusted - applied / Deferred (with rationale) / Rejected. |
