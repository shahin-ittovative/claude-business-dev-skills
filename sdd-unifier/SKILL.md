name: sdd-unifier
description: Generate, transform, or reformat Solution Design Documents (SDDs) into the user's standardised template. ALWAYS trigger when the user asks to create, generate, author, draft, write, or build an SDD, Solution Design Document, technical design document, system design document, HLD, or architecture design document. ALSO trigger when asked to transform, convert, reformat, standardise, unify, or migrate an existing SDD or technical design into this template. ALSO trigger when asked to derive, generate, or scaffold an SDD from a BRD (including the chunked or combined output of the brd-unifier skill). Output is Markdown only. Accepts an explicit mode argument: `sdd-unifier chunks` produces the multi-file chunked layout; `sdd-unifier combined` produces a single monolithic SDD; `sdd-unifier` with no argument defaults to chunks (Enter / empty / `y` / `chunks` all confirm). Default mode is CHUNKS. The skill can generate from scratch, transform an existing SDD into this template, or derive an SDD skeleton from one BRD (chunked folder or single file). This skill owns the entire HOW: the BRD (brd-unifier) is business-language only — user journeys, per-persona UC-NN use cases, a Users & Use Cases Matrix, business-level integrations and NFRs — so the SDD supplies all technical decisions, reading the BRD's Appendix § Technical Inputs for the SDD (source technical mandates parked verbatim) and falling back to CLAUDE.md defaults plus the platform architecture doctrine (EDA + DDD + hexagonal). The §6 Ecosystem Overview is never filled silently: the skill first offers the proposed ecosystem for a one-shot accept-all, and if declined walks the user through the items with BRD-informed recommendations. The template carries three platform-level catalogues beyond the per-service specs: a Centralized Event Hub (chunk 10 — the contract registry for topic names, event names, and payload contracts, which every per-service chunk must match verbatim), a Centralized User Roles & Authorities catalogue (chunk 11), and an End-to-End System Design chunk (chunk 16, authored last). The `Specs` section (Mission, Tech Stack, Roadmap, Project Type) is owned by lld-unifier, not this skill; Project Type (greenfield/brownfield) is still asked at SDD intake and gates the whole generation. Every generation run ends with a post-generation cleared-context reviewer pass producing an `Open Items & Clarifications` section (chunk 17) where every item carries a concrete Recommended Answer; the skill then walks the user through each item to accept, adjust, or defer, and reflects accepted answers into the SDD body. All diagrams are authored as inline Mermaid by default; Miro boards are produced only on explicit request.

# SDD Unifier

Author, transform, and unify Solution Design Documents (SDDs) into the user's standardised template. This skill encapsulates the full SDD section structure, the per-service spec block convention, the platform contract registries (event hub, user roles, e2e design), the chunking model, the BRD→SDD derivation rules, the interactive ecosystem selection flow, and the inline-Mermaid-first diagram policy.

The embedded templates in this skill folder are the authoritative source — `TEMPLATE-COMBINED.md` for the single-file layout and `chunks/*.md` for the chunked layout. Both were lifted verbatim from the user's working templates at `W:\ITV\STANDARDZzzz\`.

This skill is a sibling of `brd-unifier` — they work in concert when the workflow is SoW → BRD → SDD.

---

## Argument parsing — do this first

The skill is invoked with an optional argument: `sdd-unifier [chunks|combined]`.

| Argument received | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `chunks` (or empty / Enter / `y` / `yes` / `default`) | Produce multi-file chunked output | Proceed with CHUNKS mode (the default). |
| `combined` (or `c` / `single` / `one file` / `merged`) | Produce a single consolidated `.md` file | Proceed with COMBINED mode. |
| Anything else | Unrecognised | Re-prompt once with the same question; if still unclear, default to CHUNKS and note the fallback in the handoff summary. |

### Interactive mode prompt (when no arg passed)

**CHUNKS is the default.** Ask one question, accept Enter / empty / "y" as confirmation of the default. Do not ramble:

> **Output format?** [chunks / combined] — default `chunks` (press Enter to accept).
>
> - **`chunks`** (default) — multi-file layout; one `.md` per template section grouping. Matches the embedded `chunks/*.md` skeleton.
> - **`combined`** — single monolithic `.md` file matching `TEMPLATE-COMBINED.md`.

Interpretation rules:

- Empty reply / Enter / `""` / `y` / `yes` / `chunks` / `default` → **CHUNKS mode**.
- `combined` / `c` / `single` / `one file` / `merged` → **COMBINED mode**.
- Anything else → re-prompt once; if still unclear, default to CHUNKS and note the fallback.

If the user has already implied a mode in their request ("give me the full SDD as one file" → `combined`; "split it into chunks" → `chunks`), do NOT ask — proceed with the implied mode and confirm in one short line.

---

## Core principles

1. **Templates are authoritative.** `TEMPLATE-COMBINED.md` and the files under `chunks/` define the section order, naming, and structure. Section headings are never silently renamed.
2. **Markdown only.** No `.docx`, `.pdf`, `.html` unless the user explicitly asks.
3. **Mode is explicit.** Either from argument or interactive prompt. Never guess silently.
4. **Chunks are semantic, not size-based.** Never split by line count. The detailed-service chunk (`10a-service-*.md`) splits by service, not by length.
5. **Diagrams are inline Mermaid by default.** Architecture, context, workflow, sequence, ER, and state diagrams render inline in the chunks, each with a 1-2 sentence prose summary. Miro boards are produced only when the user explicitly asks — see `mermaid-diagrams.md`.
6. **Flag gaps explicitly.** Where source material doesn't cover something the template requires, insert `**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: <specific question>]**`. Never paper over gaps with plausible-sounding invention.
7. **One SDD per SoW (default).** A single SDD covers a single SoW / single BRD by default. Multi-BRD rollup is out of scope for this skill version.
8. **Use platform defaults when source is silent — and confirm them via the ecosystem selection flow.** Architecture doctrine: microservices + **EDA** (event-driven backbone, outbox mandatory) + **DDD** (bounded contexts) + **hexagonal** (ports & adapters per service). Stack defaults from CLAUDE.md: Java 21 / Spring Boot 3.5+, PostgreSQL 17+, UUIDv7, Kafka (on-prem) or SNS+SQS (AWS), Keycloak, Angular 17+ standalone. The Ecosystem Overview falls back to these unless the BRD or SoW overrides them — and is always confirmed with the user per Step 3b.
9. **Generate, transform, or derive — detect, don't ask twice.** See `transform-detection.md`.
10. **One fact, one home (no duplication).** The SDD references the BRD, never restates it: business content is cited by link + ID (reference + delta — full rules in `brd-to-sdd.md` § One fact, one home). Within the SDD, the consolidation chunks (10 event hub, 11 roles, 16 e2e) are *views* that declare their source and reference — never mirror — each other; scalar facts (counts, versions, targets) are stated once and referenced everywhere else. Restated content is a review defect (OI Type: Duplication). Only an explicitly requested standalone export may inline referenced sections, marked as inlined.
11. **Producer/consumer contracts are reconciled, never assumed.** Chunk 10 (Centralized Event Hub) is the contract registry: topic names, event names, envelope fields, and payload contracts in every per-service chunk must match it character-for-character, and consumer lists are reconciled from both the producer and consumer sides. Divergences are flagged (chunk 10 §14.8), never silently reconciled. See `chunking.md` § Contract consistency. The key goal: a smooth implementation with zero cross-service contract drift.

## Workflow

### 1. Resolve mode

Per the Argument parsing section above. Default is CHUNKS.

### 2. Resolve intent

Three possible intents:

- **GENERATE** — fresh SDD from a SoW, conversation, or topic seed. The architect supplies all technical decisions (or accepts CLAUDE.md defaults).
- **TRANSFORM** — re-shape an existing SDD (vendor template, IEEE 1016 style, prior in-house format) into this template.
- **DERIVE-FROM-BRD** — generate an SDD skeleton from a BRD (chunked folder or combined file), auto-filling BRD-derivable sections and flagging SDD-only sections with `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...]` markers.

See `transform-detection.md` for the decision rules.

### 3. Intake (short — not a clarification storm)

Ask at most **three** questions before starting:

- **Project / system name** — if not stated.
- **Source material** — fresh? Existing SDD to migrate? BRD to derive from?
- **Mode confirmation** — only if step 1 left ambiguity.

If an answer is in the conversation, do not re-ask.

### 3a. Project Type early ask + technical inputs (mandatory)

Two things happen before generation:

1. **Project Type.** If the source does not state whether this is **Greenfield** or **Brownfield**, ask this single question now via **AskUserQuestion** (load via ToolSearch if deferred):

   > "Greenfield (new product, no existing code) or Brownfield (extending an existing codebase)? If brownfield, where is the codebase?"

   **Brownfield** activates the brownfield flow: add §1 Existing System Context sub-section, mark cross-cutting concerns as inherit/override/new, flag per-service specs as extending existing services. Record the answer + a one-line justification in §1 — `lld-unifier` reads it from there when it synthesises its Specs chunk.

2. **Technical inputs from the BRD (when DERIVE-FROM-BRD).** Read the BRD's Appendix § "Technical Inputs for the SDD" — source technical mandates parked verbatim by `brd-unifier`. These are the highest-fidelity technical signal: they seed §6 Ecosystem Overview and override CLAUDE.md defaults where they conflict. Also read the BRD's Users & Use Cases Matrix and UC chunks — they drive §7 Actors/Use Cases, the §16 Centralized User Roles catalogue, and per-service authorization notes.

**Legacy BRDs:** if the source BRD contains a `Specs` section or a `Technical Implementation Expectations` section (pre-restructure template), consume them the same way — Tech Stack rows verbatim into §6, Roadmap as phasing input, Project Type as the intake answer (skip the intake question). Note "legacy BRD sections consumed" in the handoff summary.

### 3b. Ecosystem selection (mandatory, interactive — before any chunk is written)

The §6 Ecosystem Overview is never filled silently. Run this flow via **AskUserQuestion**:

1. **Assemble the proposed ecosystem.** Precedence per row: BRD Technical Inputs (verbatim, marked `BRD-mandated`) > user CLAUDE.md defaults > skill recommendation informed by the BRD (NFRs, integrations, scale signals). The architecture doctrine row defaults to **EDA + DDD + hexagonal** (principle 8).
2. **Present the full proposed table compactly** (layer → choice → source: BRD-mandated / default / recommended), then ask ONE question:

   > **Ecosystem: accept all proposed defaults?**
   > - **Accept all (Recommended)** — proceed with the table as shown.
   > - **Walk through item by item** — review each layer with recommendations.

3. **If accepted:** fill §6, marking each row's source in Notes. Done.
4. **If declined (walkthrough):** batch the remaining items through AskUserQuestion (up to 4 questions per call), grouped by concern: (a) architecture doctrine; (b) compute & runtime; (c) data — RDBMS, cache, object storage; (d) messaging & streaming; (e) identity & security — IAM, secrets; (f) edge — gateway, mesh/ingress; (g) delivery & observability — CI/CD, logs/metrics/traces; (h) application stacks — backend, frontend, BI. For every item, list the recommended option FIRST labelled "(Recommended)" with a one-line justification citing the BRD evidence that drives it (e.g., "BRD 10-nfrs NFR-03 seasonal peaks → managed streaming tier"). Offer 2-3 alternatives with one-line tradeoffs.
5. **BRD-mandated rows are not re-asked.** Show them as locked with source attribution. If the user overrides one anyway, record the deviation as an ADR in §10 and note it in the handoff summary.
6. **Every decision lands in §6** with its source in the Notes column; deviations from CLAUDE.md defaults or from the doctrine get an ADR row.

### 4. Plan internally

Enumerate which sections (combined) or chunks (chunked) will exist, which Mermaid diagrams each will carry, and which sections need `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...]` markers. The canonical chunk list is in `chunking.md`.

### 5. Diagram policy (inline Mermaid; Miro on demand)

All diagrams are authored as **inline Mermaid** in the chunks, each followed by a 1-2 sentence prose **Summary** so the content reads without a renderer. Validate every emitted Mermaid block parses; on failure, fall back to a text description + `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Mermaid syntax error — review]`. See `mermaid-diagrams.md` for the diagram-type → dialect map and conventions.

SDDs typically need: System Context, High-Level Architecture, Workflow per critical flow, Sequence per critical interaction, event-hub topology + async backbone (chunk 10), role taxonomy + authorization sequence (chunk 11), the e2e fan-out maps and sagas (chunk 16), plus per-service ERDs, flows, and sequences.

**Miro only on explicit request:** if the user asks for a Miro board, create it via the Miro MCP per `mermaid-diagrams.md` § Miro on demand and append `> Miro: <url>` links below the corresponding Mermaid blocks — the inline Mermaid stays authoritative.

### 6. Generate / transform / derive output

**CHUNKS mode (default):**

- Use `chunks/*.md` as the section skeleton.
- Write output to `./sdd-[project-slug]/`.
- Each chunk starts with the self-describing comment block (see `chunking.md`).
- For section 15 (Detailed Service Specs), produce one chunk per service: `10a-service-[slug].md`, `10b-service-[slug].md`, ...
- **Generation order for the contract chunks:** draft the per-service Event Models (10a, 10b, …) → consolidate into chunk 10 (event hub) → back-propagate fixes → author chunk 16 (e2e system design) LAST from the reconciled state.

**COMBINED mode:**

- Use `TEMPLATE-COMBINED.md` as the structure.
- Write output to `./SDD-[ProjectName]-v[X.X].md`.

**TRANSFORM intent:**

- Read the source SDD fully.
- Map content to template sections per `source-transformation.md`.
- Preserve verbatim numbers, dates, named technologies, version pins.
- Flag every gap with `**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...]**`.

**DERIVE-FROM-BRD intent:**

- Read the BRD fully (chunked folder OR combined file — see `brd-to-sdd.md` § Detecting BRD input form).
- Map BRD content to SDD sections per the table in `brd-to-sdd.md`.
- For SDD-only sections (Architecture Style, ADRs, Cross-cutting overrides, Runbook procedures), produce the heading + structure with `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...]` markers naming the specific decisions the architect must make.
- For Ecosystem Overview, apply the BRD's Appendix § "Technical Inputs for the SDD" (parked source mandates) first, then fall back to user's CLAUDE.md defaults. (Legacy BRDs: a "Technical Implementation Expectations" section plays the same role.)
- The output is intentionally an architect-ready skeleton, not a finished SDD.

### 6a. Contract consistency reconciliation (mandatory, AFTER the per-service chunks)

Before authoring chunk 16 and running the reviewer, reconcile the contract surface (see `chunking.md` § Contract consistency):

1. **Topic + event names:** every topic and event name in every `10x` Event Model matches chunk 10 §14.4/§14.5 character-for-character.
2. **Producer/consumer symmetry:** every event consumed somewhere is published by exactly one service; every producer's consumer list matches the union of the consumers' consumed tables.
3. **Payload fields:** every field a consumer's Effect column relies on exists in the §14.9 payload contract.
4. **Roles:** role names and permission tokens in per-service authorization notes match chunk 11 verbatim.
5. **Fix what you can; flag the rest** in chunk 10 §14.8 / chunk 11 §16.12 — never silently reconcile.

Then author **chunk 16 (End-to-End System Design)** from the reconciled state — it is a faithful consolidation, not new design; its counts and edges must trace to chunks 09/10/10x/11.

> **Specs note:** the constitution-grade `Specs` (Mission, Tech Stack, Roadmap, Project Type) is owned by `lld-unifier` and synthesised at LLD time from this SDD's body. This skill does NOT author a Specs chunk.

### 7. Post-generation review (mandatory, cleared-context)

After the body of the SDD is written but **before** presenting to the user, run an adversarial review pass that produces the `Open Items & Clarifications` chunk (`17-open-items-and-clarifications.md` / `# 23. Open Items & Clarifications` section in combined mode).

**Why cleared context.** The same context that authored the SDD anchors on its own architectural choices. The reviewer's job is to find what is missing or risky, not to confirm what was decided.

**How to run it.**

1. Use the `Agent` tool with `subagent_type: comprehensive-review:full-review` (preferred for SDDs given the multi-dimensional review surface) or `general-purpose`. The subagent starts with no conversation memory.
2. Pass the subagent:
   - Absolute paths to all generated SDD chunks (or the combined file).
   - The path to the source BRD (chunks folder or combined file) so the reviewer can cross-check against requirements.
   - The path to this skill's templates.
   - The brief: identify architecture-level gaps, missing scenarios, ADR ambiguities, NFR shortfalls, integration corner cases, multi-tenancy implications, inconsistencies, AND cross-chunk contract mismatches (topic/event names or payload fields diverging between chunk 10 and any 10x chunk; consumer lists that don't reconcile; roles/permission tokens diverging between chunk 11 and per-service authorization notes; counts or edges in chunk 16 that don't trace to 09/10/10x/11). For each finding, propose 2-3 concrete options with one-line tradeoffs AND a **Recommended Answer** (the concrete resolution text, written so it can be pasted into the SDD as-is — the exact row, ADR, sub-section, or wording) AND a **Why** (REQUIRED: the reason that option wins — the evidence behind it, e.g., BRD requirement, NFR, doctrine default, risk avoided, and the tradeoff accepted; never empty). Output goes into the chunk/section using the schema in `chunks/17-open-items-and-clarifications.md`.
   - Constraint: the reviewer captures **external** findings only — gaps the body did not flag inline. Inline `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...]` markers stay where they are.
3. The subagent writes directly to `17-open-items-and-clarifications.md` (chunks mode) or appends to the `# 23. Open Items & Clarifications` section (combined mode).
4. Verify coverage: at minimum one OI per major risk surface (architecture style, ADRs, cross-cutting concerns, per-service contracts, event contract consistency, NFRs, integrations, security, observability). Every OI must have a non-empty Recommended Answer AND a non-empty Why. Zero OIs typically means a confirmatory review — re-dispatch with stronger adversarial framing.

**Reviewer prompt skeleton (adapt per project):**

> You are an independent adversarial reviewer for a Solution Design Document. You have no memory of how this document was authored. Your job is to find what is missing, ambiguous, or risky in the architecture — not to confirm what is present.
>
> Read these files: [SDD paths]. Cross-reference against the source BRD: [BRD paths]. Use [TEMPLATE-COMBINED.md path] as the structural reference.
>
> For each architecture-level gap, missing scenario, corner case, ambiguity, risk, NFR shortfall, inconsistency, or contract mismatch, write an OI entry following the schema in [chunks/17-open-items-and-clarifications.md path]. Each entry must include: Where (§N or service), Type, Concern (one paragraph), Options (at least 2 with tradeoffs), **Recommended Answer (the concrete resolution text, ready to paste into the SDD)**, **Why (the reason that option wins over the alternatives — evidence + tradeoff accepted; never empty)**, Status: Open.
>
> Cover at minimum: architecture style fit (EDA/DDD/hexagonal doctrine adherence), ADR completeness, cross-cutting concerns coverage, per-service contract completeness, **event contract consistency (every topic name, event name, and payload field in each per-service Event Model must match §14 the Centralized Event Hub verbatim; every consumed event must have exactly one producer; consumer lists must reconcile from both sides)**, **role catalogue consistency (per-service authorization notes vs §16)**, **e2e traceability (§22 counts and edges trace to §13/§14/§15/§16)**, NFR realisability (the BRD states NFRs in business language — check the SDD quantified them technically), integration error paths and timeouts, multi-tenancy edge cases, observability gaps, security/compliance hooks (cross-check per-service authorization against the BRD's Users & Use Cases Matrix), deployment failure modes, runbook completeness, BRD-to-SDD traceability gaps (every BRD UC lands in a service), and duplication (BRD content restated instead of referenced with a delta; chunk-16 mirrors of chunk 10/11 content; the same scalar fact stated in two places — one fact, one home).
>
> Do not echo what the document says. Do not confirm. Find what is missing. Write directly to [output path].

### 8. Open Items review & acceptance loop (mandatory)

The Open Items are not left for the user to discover — walk them through each item and get a decision:

1. Present the OI list compactly (ID, title, one-line concern, the Recommended Answer and its Why).
2. Ask the user to decide per item, batched via **AskUserQuestion** (up to 4 items per call); the recommended option's description carries its Why so the user decides with the reason in view. Options per item: **Accept recommendation** (recommended, listed first) / **Choose option [B/C]** / **Defer** / user types their own answer via "Other".
3. For every **accepted** (or user-adjusted) item: apply the Recommended Answer (or adjusted text) to the referenced chunk(s)/section(s); set the OI's Status to `Accepted - applied` (or `Adjusted - applied`); add a Resolution Log row; bump the Changes Log in chunk 00 once for the batch. If the change touches event contracts, roles, or services, re-verify chunks 10/11/16 still reconcile with the affected `10x` chunks.
4. **Deferred / Rejected** items keep their entry with the new status and rationale; they are not applied.
5. If the user says "later" / "I'll review offline", leave all items `Open` and note in the handoff that the acceptance loop is pending — do not apply anything without an explicit decision.

### 9. Present

After the body, the Open Items chunk, and the acceptance loop, surface to the user:

- Project name, version, mode (chunks / combined), file paths.
- Number of chunks (if chunks mode) or section count (if combined).
- Count of inline Mermaid diagrams generated (and the Miro board URL, only if one was requested).
- Ecosystem selection outcome: accepted-all or walked-through, with the list of user overrides and BRD-mandated rows.
- Contract consistency status: reconciled ✓, plus any flags left in chunk 10 §14.8 / chunk 11 §16.12.
- Count of inline `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...]` markers — explicit body-level gap inventory, with a list of the SDD-only sections that need the architect's input.
- Open Items summary: total, accepted & applied, adjusted, deferred, rejected, still open.
- Chain handoff check: every `../brd-[slug]/...` reference resolves against the actual BRD folder; BRD content is referenced + delta, never restated; chunk names match the canonical map so `lld-unifier` can consume them.
- Reminder line: "Specs (Mission / Tech Stack / Roadmap / Project Type) is synthesised by lld-unifier from this SDD."
- One-line offer: "Want me to switch modes?" / "Want me to merge?" / "Want me to fill in section X now that you have decisions?"

### 10. Cross-mode conversion (on explicit request)

| User says | Action |
|---|---|
| "merge", "consolidate", "single file", "full doc" (after chunks exist) | Concatenate per `chunking.md` § Merge handling. Write to `./sdd-[project-slug]/SDD-[ProjectName]-v[X.X]-MERGED.md` (alongside the chunks). Keep originals. |
| "split into chunks", "re-chunk this" (when a combined file exists) | Slice by template section per `chunks/*.md` skeleton. Keep the original combined file. |
| "regenerate chunk N", "update section X", "fill in section Y now that I have decisions" | Targeted regeneration of one chunk or section, leaving the rest untouched. Bump the Changes Log. |

---

## Reference files (read these when the situation calls for them)

- `TEMPLATE-COMBINED.md` — the single-file template. Read at the start of any COMBINED-mode generation.
- `chunks/*.md` — the per-chunk template skeletons. Read at the start of any CHUNKS-mode generation.
- `chunking.md` — canonical chunk map, naming convention, merge rules.
- `modes.md` — chunks vs combined behavioural details.
- `transform-detection.md` — rules for deciding generate / transform / derive-from-BRD.
- `source-transformation.md` — how to map SoW or existing-SDD content into this template.
- `brd-to-sdd.md` — explicit BRD→SDD field mapping (read this when the source is a BRD; covers the business-language BRD shape: UC chunks, Users & Use Cases Matrix, parked technical inputs, legacy Specs handling).
- `sdd-quality.md` — what makes a substantive section vs a thin one (analogous to fr-quality.md in brd-unifier).
- `mermaid-diagrams.md` — inline Mermaid conventions per diagram type, plus the Miro-on-demand flow.

---

## Output conventions

- **Project slug**: kebab-case, lowercased, derived from project name.
- **Chunked output folder**: `./sdd-[project-slug]/`.
- **Chunked filenames**: `NN-short-title.md` (two-digit prefix, optional letter for service splits like `10a`, `10b`). See `chunking.md`.
- **Combined output filename**: `SDD-[ProjectName]-v[X.X].md` (PascalCase project name).
- **Merged-from-chunks filename**: `SDD-[ProjectName]-v[X.X]-MERGED.md`, written inside `./sdd-[project-slug]/` alongside the chunks.
- **Encoding**: UTF-8, LF line endings.
- **Tables**: pipe-table format, no hard line wrap.

---

## Things this skill never does

- Never emits `.docx`, `.pdf`, `.xlsx`, or any non-Markdown output unless the user explicitly asks.
- Never creates a Miro board unless the user explicitly asks. Inline Mermaid is the authoritative diagram medium; Miro links are additive.
- Never fills the §6 Ecosystem Overview silently — the ecosystem selection flow (Step 3b) always runs.
- Never authors a `Specs` chunk — Specs (Mission, Tech Stack, Roadmap, Project Type) is owned by `lld-unifier` and synthesised from this SDD.
- Never lets per-service event tables drift from chunk 10. A topic/event/payload divergence is fixed or flagged (chunk 10 §14.8), never left silently inconsistent.
- Never invents performance targets, version pins, technology choices, or capacity numbers to fill a table. Missing target → `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...]`.
- Never produces a "here's a summary, let me know if you want the full version" preview. Generate the actual deliverable.
- Never silently drops template sections. Empty sections keep their heading and write `Not applicable for this release.` (with a clarification flag if surprising).
- Never modifies the embedded templates (`TEMPLATE-COMBINED.md` or `chunks/*.md`) during a generation run — they are read-only references.
- Never writes a per-service detailed spec from the BRD alone. The BRD doesn't have enough technical specificity; per-service detailed specs (DB Modeling, API list, Event Model) need architect input or are flagged.
